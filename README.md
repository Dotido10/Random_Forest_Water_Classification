# Random_Forest_Water_Classification
For this work, we will use data from the Sentinel-2 instrument and a Random Forest algorithm to perform water classification.

The intent of this notebook is two-fold:

First, we will perform some training using the Random Forest algorithm.

Second, we will perform inference using the Random Forest algorithm, and will include some metrics to analyze its performance.

For this exercise we have downloaded our features data from the copernicus platform by using the Google Earth Engine .

We digitized manually our labeled data from the sentinel-2 image by using the QGIS software. Water extend frorm Lakes Azeui and Enriquillo in the island of Haiti were used.
